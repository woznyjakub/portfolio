## \_pages

Folder for pages components. Unfortunatelly the Gatsby does not allow us to have file structure like the one from `pages` folder. Page components from here are imported in the `pages`.

I tried to move GraphQL queries here, but I always get errors when it is outside of the `pages` folder.
